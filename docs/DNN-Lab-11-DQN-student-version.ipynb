        "* experience replay - used to increase efficacy of samples from the environment and decorrelate elements of a batch,\n",
        "* target network - used to avoid constantly changing targets in the learning process (to avoid \"chasing own tail\").\n",

        "For algorithm's details recall the lecture and/or follow the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602), which is rather self-contained and not hard to understand.\n",

        "Without changing any hyperparameters, the agent should solve the problem (obtain rewards ~200) after ~1000 episodes, which for GPU runtime takes ~10 minutes of training.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can run this code locally (not in Colab), which allows to see the agent in action, unfortunately visualization inside Colab worked poorly and was removed from this lab scenario."
